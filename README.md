# CS50-PSet-6-DNA

A program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs, for Harvard's CS50 problems set 6.

## Specifications:

1. The program should require as its first command-line argument the name of a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals and should require as its second command-line argument the name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify.

2. Program should open the CSV file and read its contents into memory.

3. Program should open the DNA sequence and read its contents into memory.

4. For each of the STRs, program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of the STR in the DNA sequence to identify.

5. If the STR counts match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, program should print out the name of the matching individual.
